# 📝 Important notes

📂 Naming Convention
Folders are prefixed with their programming language for quick identification:
 * **** — c++/project-name
 * **** — c#/project-name
> [!TIP]
> Why this format? > This allows the directory structure to act as a built-in filter, making it obvious what language each project uses at a glance.
> 
> [!CAUTION]
> Remember to wrap paths in quotes when using the terminal:
> cd "c++/my-app"
>
